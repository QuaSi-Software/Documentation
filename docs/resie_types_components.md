# Types of energy system components
This document provides details on the component models and their implementations.

The description of each component type includes a block with a number of attributes that describe the type and how it connects to other components by its input and output interfaces. An example of such a block:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Type name** | `BoundedSink`|
| **File** | `energy_systems/general/bounded_sink.jl` |
| **Available models** | `default` |
| **System function** | `bounded_sink` |
| **Medium** | `medium`/`None` |
| **Input media** | `None`/`auto` |
| **Output media** | |
| **Tracked values** | `IN`, `Max_Energy` |

The available models listed are subtypes to the implementation of a component, which each work slightly differently and might use different parameters. An example is the difference between a condensing gas boiler and a traditional one. **Note: At the moment there is no argument for the model, as each component currently only has one implemented model. In the future this will be extended to include a default model (when no argument is provided) and additional optional models.**

Of particular note are the descriptions of the medium (if it applies) of the component type and its input and output interfaces. The `Medium` is used for components that could handle any type of medium and need to be configured to work with a specific medium. The attributes `Input media` and `Output media` describes which input and output interfaces the type provides and how the media of those can be configured. The syntax `name:value` lists the name of the parameter in the input data that defines the medium first, followed by a forward slash and the default value of the medium second, if any. A value of `None` implies that no default is set and therefore it must be given in the input data. A value of `auto` implies that the value is determined with no required input, usually from the `Medium`.

The `Tracked values` attribute lists which values of the component can be tracked with the output specification in the input file (see [this section](resie_input_file_format.md#output-specification-csv-file) for details). Note that a value of `IN` or `OUT` refers to all input or output interfaces of the component. Which these are can be infered from the input and output media attributes and the chosen medium names if they differ from the default values.
% Last Sentence starts wrong.

The description further lists which arguments the implementation takes. Let's take a look at an example:

| Name | Type | R/D | Example | Description |
| ----------- | ------- | --- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `max_power_profile_file_path` | `String` | Y/N | `profiles/district/max_power.prf` | Path to the max power profile. |
| `efficiency` | `Float` | Y/Y | 0.8 | Ratio of output over input energies. |
| `static_temperature` | `Temperature` | N/N | 65.0 | If given, sets the temperature of the heat output to a static value. |

The name of the entries should match the keys in the input file, which is carried verbatim as entries to the dictionary argument of the component's constructor. The column `R/D` lists if the argument is required (`R`) and if it has a default value (`D`). If the argument has a default value the example value given in the next column also lists what that default value is. Otherwise the example column shows what a value might look like.

The type refers to the type it is expected to have after being parsed by the JSON library. The type `Temperature` is an internal structure and simply refers to either `Float` or `Nothing`, the null-type in Julia. In general, a temperature of `Nothing` implies that any temperature is accepted and only the amount of energy is revelant. More restrictive number types are automatically cast to their superset, but *not* the other way around, e.g: \(UInt \rightarrow Int \rightarrow Float \rightarrow Temperature\). Dictionaries given in the `{"key":value}` notation in JSON are parsed as `Dict{String,Any}`.
